## 1. THE STORY

### The Golden Age

Sosaria was a world of wonder. Under Lord British's protection, the moongates
connected distant lands, commerce flourished, and the defeat of Mondain and
Minax seemed to promise lasting peace. It was the Golden Age — and it ended
in a single night.

### The Breach

Without warning, a rift opened in the sky above the center of the world. From
it poured an alien presence — not a creature, but an intelligence, vast and
incomprehensible. It did not conquer. It *replaced*. Reality itself began to
rewrite around its will.

Lord British vanished on the first night. His castle was sealed by null fields
that no spell could penetrate. The forests mutated into towering fungal
growths that pulse with bioluminescent light. The mountains crystallized into
jagged spires that hum at frequencies that drive men mad. The seas turned to
acrid brine.

The entity came to be called the **Voidborn** — though to name it is to
misunderstand it. It is not evil in any human sense. It is alien, vast, and
indifferent. It expands because that is its nature, the way fire burns or
water flows downhill.

### The Ashen Age

What remains of Sosaria is the **Ashen Realm** — a world half-consumed by
something no one fully comprehends. The sky is perpetually overcast, tinged
violet at the horizon. The few survivors cluster in walled settlements called
Havens, trading scraps and rumors.

The moongates have become **Void Rifts** — unstable tears in reality that
shift position with the moons, spewing corrupted matter. The dungeons have
become **Abysses** that descend into the Voidborn's domain. Something stirs
at the bottom, building a physical form from stolen reality.

But there is hope — fragile, desperate hope. The Prophet (the being once
known as Lord British) left echoes of guidance in his sealed Bastion. Four
ancient **Sigils** once held the seal of reality together. Four **Shards** of
power lie hidden in the deepest Abysses. Together, they can close the Breach
and sever the Voidborn's connection to the world.

Your quest is not heroic triumph. It is desperate necessity.

### Factions

**The Prophet**: Trapped in the sealed Bastion, visible only through null
field shimmer. His echoes provide cryptic guidance and reveal the locations
of the Sigils.

**Haven Councils**: Each surviving town is governed by a desperate council.
They distrust outsiders but offer supplies and rumors in exchange for proof
of the party's strength.

**The Void Cult**: Former citizens who believe the Voidborn is a god. They
worship at corrupted shrines, channel rift energy to feed the entity, and
attack those who seek the Sigils. Their leader, the Eyeless Seer, guards the
approach to the final Abyss.

---

## 2. GETTING STARTED

You begin at the **Prophet's Bastion** (coordinates 28, 35), the last safe
place in the Ashen Realm. The Bastion's null field barrier is failing —
strange sounds echo through the halls, and the guards speak of nightmares
made real.

**Your first steps:**

1. Speak to everyone in the Bastion. The Echo in the throne room gives you
   your primary objective: find four Sigils in the corrupted shrines.
2. Check your party's equipment at the Bastion shops.
3. Stock up on food — it depletes twice as fast in the Ashen Realm as it did
   in old Sosaria.
4. Venture outside and fight the weakest enemies on the ash plains to build
   strength before seeking the first shrine.

**Survival tips from the Ashfall Herbalist:**

- If ichor burns you, pack ash on the wound. It draws the poison out.
- Do not travel the ash plains at night. The Thralls hunt by sound.
- If the spires go silent, run.
- Never eat anything that pulses. If it has a heartbeat, it is a lure.

## 3. YOUR PARTY

Four survivors have banded together at the Prophet's Bastion. Each brings
unique skills essential to the quest.

### KAEL — The Warden

| Race | Human |
| Class | Ranger |
| Gender | Male |
| HP | 250 |
| MP | 15 |
| STR / DEX / INT / WIS | 30 / 45 / 20 / 25 |
| Weapon | Blade (Sword) |
| Armor | Links (Chain) |
| Inventory | Blade, Bow |

Former ranger of the old king's scouts. Survived the Breach by instinct
alone. Haunted by what he saw in the first hours. His high dexterity makes
him effective with ranged weapons, and his mixed stats give him minor
spellcasting ability.

### LYRA — The Seer

| Race | Elf |
| Class | Wizard |
| Gender | Female |
| HP | 150 |
| MP | 50 |
| STR / DEX / INT / WIS | 15 / 30 / 50 / 40 |
| Weapon | Shiv (Dagger) |
| Armor | Rags (Cloth) |
| Inventory | Shiv |

An elven scholar who gazed too long into a Void Rift. Now sees glimpses of
the Voidborn's intent — a gift that may be a curse. Your primary spellcaster
with the highest intelligence and magic points. Keep her protected behind
the front line.

### THARN — The Bulwark

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Race | Dwarf |
| Class | Fighter |

| STR / DEX / INT / WIS | 50 / 25 / 15 / 20 |
| Weapon | Axe |
| Armor | Plate |
| Inventory | Axe, Club |

Last of the Ironhold garrison. Carries a shield forged before the Breach,
one of the few artifacts the void cannot corrode. Your tank — highest HP,
highest strength, heaviest armor. No magic, but he doesn't need it.

### MIRA — The Ghost

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Race | Bobbit |
| Class | Thief |
| Gender | Female |
| HP | 180 |
| MP | 20 |
| STR / DEX / INT / WIS | 20 / 50 / 35 / 30 |
| Weapon | Shiv (Dagger) |
| Armor | Hide (Leather) |
| Inventory | 2x Shiv, Sling |

A former merchant's daughter who learned to move unseen when the Thralls came
for her village. Trusts no one but the party. Highest dexterity in the group.
Her sling provides ranged attack capability, and she carries the most keys
(10) and torches (20) — essential for the Abysses.

### Party Resources

|----------|------|------|-------|------|-------|

---

## 5. THE ASHEN REALM

The overworld map is a 64x64 grid of corrupted terrain. What was once Sosaria
is now a nightmare landscape.

### Terrain Types

| Terrain | Description | Effect |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Brine | Corrupted sea, acrid and dark | Impassable on foot; requires Raft |
| Ash | Grey plains, sparse and desolate | Standard traversal |
| Thorns | Spiky corrupted vegetation | Slow movement |
| Mycelium | Towering fungal forest, bioluminescent | Obscures vision, stronger enemies |
| Spires | Crystallized mountain ranges | Impassable; hum at maddening frequencies |
| Abyss | Entrance to underground depths | Enter to descend |
| Haven | Surviving walled settlement | Enter for shops and NPCs |
| Bastion | Fortified military structure | Enter for quest NPCs |
| Rift | Void tear, shifts with moons | Dangerous — can transport or damage |
| Ichor | Liquid corruption (lava equivalent) | Deadly on contact |
| Null Field | Protective energy barrier | Blocks movement; damages magic |
| Ruin | Collapsed structures | Impassable |
| Void | Empty space between reality | Impassable |

### Threats on the Overworld

Travel between Havens is dangerous. The ash plains (MONA encounters) contain
the weakest enemies but can still overwhelm an unprepared party. The fungal
forests (MONB) and crystal spire regions (MONC) are progressively more
dangerous. The brine seas (MOND) require a Raft and host their own threats.

### Food Depletion

**Warning:** Food depletes at **double the normal rate** in the Ashen Realm.
The corruption accelerates consumption. Stock up at every Haven you visit.
Pool your gold (J) and buy rations frequently.

---

## 6. HAVENS & BASTIONS

### Bastions (Castles)

| Location | Name | Role |
|----------|------|------|
| MAPB | The Prophet's Bastion | Home base, quest hub |
| MAPC | The Eyeless Spire | Void Cult HQ (hostile) |
| MAPZ | The Voidborn's Nexus | Final area |

### Havens (Towns)

| Location | Name | Key Feature |
|----------|------|-------------|
| MAPD | Ashfall | First haven, survival tips, basic supplies |
| MAPE | Duskhollow | Flame Sigil hints, smith upgrades with crystal |
| MAPF | Grimwall | Northern fortress, paranoid council, fortification |
| MAPG | Riftwatch | Rift research, scholar maps rift cycles |
| MAPH | Thornhaven | Fungal forest village, mushroom lore |
| MAPI | Ironhold East | Mining settlement, void crystals, gem trade |
| MAPJ | Ironhold West | Forge, void-crystal alloy weapons |
| MAPK | The Last Wall | Border garrison, final preparations |

### The Deep Reef

| Location | Name | Role |
|----------|------|------|
| MAPL | The Deep Reef | Submerged realm, ancient coral lore, accessible via maelstrom |

---

## 7. SHOPS & SERVICES

Eight types of shops exist across the Havens:

| Shop | Name | Service |
|------|------|---------|
| Void Arms | Weapons | Buy and sell weapons |
| Ward Shop | Armor | Buy and sell armor |
| Rations | Food | Buy food supplies |
| Refuge | Tavern | Rest and hear rumors |
| Shadows | Guild | Purchase spells and skills |
| Mender | Healer | Cure poison, heal, resurrect |
| Haven | Inn | Rest to restore HP |
| Oracle | Oracle | Receive prophecy and quest hints |

**Economy note:** Resources are scarce in the Ashen Realm. Prices are high,
supplies limited. Pool your gold (J) and spend wisely. The Ironhold towns
have the best gear but the highest prices.

---

## 8. WEAPONS & ARMOR

### Weapons

Listed from weakest to strongest. Class restrictions from vanilla Ultima III
still apply.

| # | Name | Type | Notes |
|---|------|------|-------|
| 0 | Fist | Unarmed | No weapon equipped |
| 1 | Shiv | Light blade | Starting weapon for Wizard/Thief |
| 2 | Club | Bludgeon | Cheap, reliable |
| 3 | Sling | Ranged | Budget ranged option |
| 4 | Axe | Melee | Solid mid-tier |
| 5 | Bow | Ranged | Best ranged weapon before enchanted tier |
| 6 | Blade | Sword | Reliable all-purpose |
| 7 | Glaive | Two-handed | Highest base damage, Fighter only |
| 8 | V-Axe | Void-touched Axe | Enchanted — effective against void creatures |
| 9 | V-Bow | Void-touched Bow | Enchanted ranged |
| 10 | V-Swd | Void-touched Sword | Best mid-tier enchanted melee |
| 11 | Talons | Fighting gloves | Martial arts — unique playstyle |
| 12 | D-Axe | Doom Axe | Ultimate axe tier |
| 13 | D-Bow | Doom Bow | Ultimate ranged tier |
| 14 | D-Swd | Doom Sword | Ultimate sword tier |
| 15 | Null | Exotic | Void-aligned — the most powerful weapon |

**Void-touched (V-)** weapons are forged with void crystal alloys at the
Ironhold West smithy. They are essential for mid-game Abyss exploration.

**Doom (D-)** weapons represent the ultimate tier, available only through
the Master Smith with rare deep ore and void crystals.

**Null** weapons are exotic void-aligned artifacts, the rarest and most
powerful arms in the Ashen Realm.

### Armor

| # | Name | Type | Notes |
|---|------|------|-------|
| 0 | Skin | Unarmored | No protection |
| 1 | Rags | Light cloth | Minimal protection, no speed penalty |
| 2 | Hide | Leather | Balanced defense and mobility |
| 3 | Links | Chain mail | Good protection |
| 4 | Plate | Heavy plate | Best non-enchanted defense |
| 5 | V-Links | Void-warded Chain | Crystal-threaded — resists void corruption |
| 6 | V-Plate | Void-warded Plate | Heavy void-resistant armor |
| 7 | Ward | Exotic | Void-aligned protection — the ultimate defense |

**Tip from the Ironhold Armorer:** "Plate mail saves lives but slows you
down. Against Thralls, speed matters more. Chain with crystal threading
resists void corruption. Expensive, but you only die once."

---

## 9. VOID ARTS & WARDING RITES

Magic in the Ashen Realm has been reshaped by the Breach. The old spell names
are forgotten. What remains are two schools of power.

### Void Arts (Wizard Spells)

Offensive and utility magic that manipulates the fabric of reality. Lyra's
primary tool — but beware: **many deep Abyss creatures can negate magic
entirely.**

| # | Spell | MP | Effect |
|---|-------|----|--------|
| 1 | Spark | 5 | Magical bolt — basic damage |
| 2 | Shard | 5 | Projectile attack |
| 3 | Warp | 10 | Light/illumination |
| 4 | Rend | 15 | Descend one Abyss level |
| 5 | Drain | 15 | Ascend one Abyss level |
| 6 | Tear | 20 | Lightning strike |
| 7 | Crush | 25 | Area damage |
| 8 | Scry | 25 | Divination |
| 9 | Blight | 30 | Curse enemies |
| 10 | Scour | 30 | Purification |
| 11 | Toxin | 35 | Poison application |
| 12 | Unmake | 40 | Disintegrate — powerful single target |
| 13 | Shift | 40 | Transformation/escape |
| 14 | Rift | 50 | Open portal |
| 15 | Annul | 50 | Negate enemy magic |

### Warding Rites (Cleric Spells)

Defensive, healing, and support magic. The backbone of party survival,
especially in the deep Abysses where offensive magic is negated.

| # | Spell | MP | Effect |
|---|-------|----|--------|
| 1 | Mend | 5 | Basic healing |
| 2 | Glow | 5 | Light source |
| 3 | Shield | 10 | Protection boost |
| 4 | Luminae | 10 | Divine radiance |
| 5 | Slow | 15 | Debuff enemy speed |
| 6 | Rest | 15 | Party recovery |
| 7 | Heal | 20 | Major healing |
| 8 | Purge | 20 | Cure poison — essential |
| 9 | Follow | 25 | Summon aid |
| 10 | Sleep | 25 | Crowd control |
| 11 | Bless | 30 | Stat enhancement |
| 12 | Guide | 30 | Navigation assistance |
| 13 | Banish | 40 | Holy damage vs void creatures |
| 14 | Cleanse | 40 | Deep purification |
| 15 | Veil | 50 | Invisibility |
| 16 | Restore | 50 | Full HP restoration |

**Critical note on magic negation:** Many boss creatures and deep Abyss
dwellers possess the **negate** ability, which nullifies all magic. When
facing these enemies, rely on steel. As the veteran at The Last Wall says:
*"The boss creatures negate magic. Do not rely on spells alone. Carry steel
and use it."*

---

## 10. BESTIARY

Creatures of the Ashen Realm are organized by the regions where they appear.
Stats shown are representative ranges per encounter table.

### Ash Plains (MONA) — Overworld Grasslands

| Creature | HP | ATK | DEF | SPD | Special |
|----------|----|-----|-----|-----|---------|
| Thrall (weakest) | 40-55 | 25-30 | 12-18 | 15-30 | — |

mushrooms at all."*

### Crystal Spires (MONC) — Mountain Regions

| Creature | HP | ATK | DEF | SPD | Special |
|----------|----|-----|-----|-----|---------|

| Crystal Titan (boss) | 120-160 | 62-70 | 42-50 | 8-12 | Boss |

*"The spires to the north hum louder each week. When they go silent, run."*

### Brine Sea (MOND) — Naval Encounters

| Creature | HP | ATK | DEF | SPD | Special |

| Kraken (boss) | 100-110 | 52-55 | 38-40 | 12-15 | Boss |

### Haven Guards (MONE) — Town Defenders

Guards are not enemies but will fight if provoked. They range from Watchmen
(HP 50, ATK 30) to the Lord Protector (HP 100, ATK 50, Boss). Do not attack
the Havens — you need their services.

### Bastion Forces (MONJ) — Castle Soldiers

Military defenders range from Sentries (HP 100, ATK 50) to the Bastion
Overlord (HP 180, ATK 75, Boss). The Eyeless Spire's garrison will be
hostile.

### Deep Reef (MONK) — Aquatic Encounters

| Creature | HP | ATK | DEF | SPD | Special |
|----------|----|-----|-----|-----|---------|
| Reef Lurker | 140 | 60 | 40 | 22 | — |

| Fission Anemone | 178 | 70 | 50 | 16 | **Divide** |
| Tidal Mimic | 198 | 76 | 56 | 20 | **Divide** |
| Hydra Spawn | 220 | 82 | 62 | 14 | **Divide** |
| Colony Mind | 230 | 84 | 65 | 12 | Boss, **Divide** |
| The Undercurrent | 240 | 85 | 68 | 16 | Boss, **Divide** |

**Divide** creatures split into two weaker copies when damaged. Area damage
spells are essential here. Fire does not work underwater.

*"The creatures that divide in two when struck infest the lower depths."*

### Void Cult (MONL) — Special Encounters

| Creature | HP | ATK | DEF | SPD | Special |
|----------|----|-----|-----|-----|---------|
| Cult Initiate | 180 | 70 | 48 | 22 | — |
| Phase Zealot | 188 | 72 | 50 | 20 | **Teleport** |
| Warp Dancer | 205 | 76 | 55 | 20 | **Teleport** |
| Cult Poisoner | 215 | 78 | 58 | 16 | Poison |

| Null Priest | 255 | 88 | 68 | 18 | **Teleport**, Negate |
| The Eyeless Oracle | 255 | 95 | 80 | 18 | Boss, **Teleport**, Negate |

*"The Void Cult channels energy from the rifts to feed the Voidborn. Cut the
channels, cut the power."*

### Ultimate Bosses (MONZ)

These entities appear in the endgame. All are boss-class. Most negate magic.

| Creature | HP | ATK | DEF | SPD | Special |
|----------|----|-----|-----|-----|---------|
| Spore Colossus | 200 | 90 | 65 | 20 | Boss |
| Null Behemoth | 203 | 95 | 70 | 18 | Boss, Negate |
| The Drowned King | 211 | 100 | 75 | 16 | Boss, Negate |
| Void Colossus | 218 | 108 | 80 | 14 | Boss, Negate |
| The Eyeless Throne | 222 | 110 | 82 | 18 | Boss, Negate |
| Breach Titan | 225 | 115 | 85 | 15 | Boss |
| Entropy Lord | 229 | 118 | 88 | 20 | Boss, Negate |
| The Hungering Maw | 233 | 120 | 90 | 12 | Boss, Negate |
| Void Wyrm | 236 | 125 | 92 | 18 | Boss, Negate |
| The Silence | 240 | 130 | 95 | 16 | Boss, Negate |

| **The Voidborn** | **255** | **150** | **99** | **20** | **Boss, Negate** |

The Voidborn itself is the final boss — maximum HP, devastating attack,
near-impervious defense, and complete magic negation. You cannot defeat it
through combat alone. You must activate the seal.

---

## 11. THE ABYSSES

Seven Abysses descend into the Voidborn's domain. Each has 8 levels of
increasing danger and a distinct theme. The four key Shards (corresponding
to the Cards of the old world) are found in the deepest levels.

### Encounter Difficulty by Abyss Level

| Levels | Encounter | HP Range | ATK Range | Special Abilities |
|--------|-----------|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1-2 | MONF | 80-150 | 45-65 | — |
| 3-4 | MONG | 120-200 | 55-80 | Sleep |
| 5-6 | MONH | 160-280 | 65-90 | Poison, Boss |
| 7-8 | MONI | 200-400 | 80-120 | **Boss, Negate** |

### The Seven Abysses

#### Abyss of Flame (MAPM) — Shard of the Sun

*"The magma rises when it senses you. This place is alive and hungry."*

Theme: Fire and magma. Heat damage, ichor pools. The Shard of Flame burns
in the lowest chamber. Touching it triggers a vision of the Breach opening.

**Key NPC quote:** *"Fire cannot kill what was never alive. The void laughs
at your flames."*

#### Abyss of Madness (MAPN) — Shard of the Moon

*"Are you real? I cannot tell. The walls breathe and the floor speaks my
name."*

Theme: Shifting walls, time distortion, hallucinations. The Shard of Mind
whispers. If you hear singing, walk the other way.

**Key NPC quote:** *"It shows you what you want to see. Then it takes that
away. Then it takes everything else."*

#### Abyss of Serpents (MAPO) — Shard of the Heart

*"The venom is in the air here. Cover your mouth."*

Theme: Poison and ambush. The serpents are intelligent — they think, plan,
and herd you toward the pit. The Shard of Scale lies in the mother serpent's
nest at the bottom.

**Key NPC quote:** *"TRUST NOTHING THAT SLITHERS. THE FLOOR IS NOT ALWAYS
THE FLOOR."*

#### Abyss of Chains (MAPP)

*"They chained me here as a warning. I stole from the Cult."*

Theme: Imprisonment and binding. A spectral guard stands eternal watch,
dead but still on duty. The Shard of Bonds holds him there.

**Key NPC quote:** *"The chains that bind the willing are the strongest.
The void offers chains gladly."*

#### Abyss of Time (MAPQ) — Shard of the Skull

*"You have been here before. You will be here again. The loop tightens."*

Theme: Temporal distortion. Time freezes, loops, and fractures. The Shard of
Hours freezes what it touches — do not grasp it with bare hands. Wrap it.

**Key NPC quote:** *"TIME IS THE FIRST THING THE VOID CONSUMES. IF YOU
FORGET THE SUN, YOU ARE ALREADY LOST."*

#### Abyss of Echoes (MAPR)

*"Can you hear me? I am the echo of the last one who came here."*

Theme: Sound-based traps. The walls repeat not just sound but people. Do not
touch the walls. The Shard of Voice screams endlessly — follow the scream to
find it.

**Key NPC quote:** *"EVERY ECHO IS A COPY. EVERY COPY LOSES SOMETHING. THE
VOID IS THE LAST ECHO."*

#### Abyss of Shadows (MAPS)

*"I am what you hide from yourself. Face me."*

Theme: Darkness and self-confrontation. The Voidborn does not create shadows —
it reveals them. Everything here was always inside you. The Shard of Night
drinks light and courage.

**Key NPC quote:** *"THE LAST SHARD COMPLETES THE SEAL. BRING ALL FOUR TO
THE SANCTUM. END THIS."*

### Abyss Survival Guide

1. **Torches** are essential. Bring at least 15 per Abyss run.
2. **Keys** open locked passages. Mira carries the most.
3. **Gems** let you peer at the dungeon map — invaluable for navigation.
4. Levels 1-2 are manageable with basic gear.
5. Levels 3-4 require void-touched (V-) weapons and armor.
6. Levels 5-6 demand full healing support (Purge, Heal, Restore).
7. **Levels 7-8 monsters negate all magic.** Bring your best steel.

## 12. SPECIAL LOCATIONS

### Shrine of Immolation (BRND)

The corrupted Brand shrine, surrounded by ichor pools. The **Sigil of Flame**
awaits at the central ankh. Guarded by Pyric Horrors.

*Duskhollow's Elder Syl:* "The Shrine of Immolation lies where Brand once
stood. Only flame can purify the corruption there."

### Corrupted Shrines (SHRN)

Three shrines in one location, holding the **Sigils of Binding, Venom, and
Dominion**. Null field perimeters block direct approach. Void Cult members
attack on sight.

### Ichor Wells (FNTN)

Four pools of liquid corruption. Drinking from them modifies stats — but the
effect is random. Risk and reward. Some pools heal; others poison.

*The Ashfall Herbalist:* "The fungal growths are toxic, but some have uses."

### The Chronarch's Sanctum (TIME)

The final seal activation point. A null field maze leads to the central ankh
where the eight tokens (four Sigils + four Shards) combine to close the
Breach. The path is guarded by reality distortions and the Voidborn's most
powerful servants.

---

## 13. MAIN QUEST WALKTHROUGH

### Act 1: Awakening (Levels 1-3)

**Objective:** Learn the quest. Gather basic supplies. Build strength.

1. **Prophet's Bastion** — Talk to The Echo. Learn about the four Sigils.
   *"Four Sigils hold the seal. Find them in corrupted shrines."*

2. **Ashfall** (nearest haven) — Buy rations, talk to the Herbalist for
   survival tips. The Trader mentions a smith in Duskhollow.

3. **Grind on the Ash Plains** — Fight Thralls and Husks (MONA encounters,
   HP 40-85) until the party is strong enough to travel further.

4. **Duskhollow** — Elder Syl reveals the location of the first Sigil:
   *"The Shrine of Immolation lies where Brand once stood."*
   Scout Brynn provides directions through the ash plains.

### Act 2: The Sigils (Levels 3-7)

**Objective:** Recover all four Sigils from the corrupted shrines.

5. **Shrine of Immolation (BRND)** — Navigate through ichor pools to reach
   the central ankh. Fight Pyric Horrors. Claim the **Sigil of Flame**.

6. **Grimwall** — Resupply. Commander Hask warns about the northern spires
   and Thralls that wear familiar faces.

7. **Riftwatch** — The Rift Scholar explains the Sigil-to-Breach connection:
   *"Each Sigil sealed corresponds to a weakening in the Breach."*

8. **Corrupted Shrines (SHRN)** — Three Sigils in one dangerous location:
   - **Sigil of Binding** (Force) — guarded by Null Wardens
   - **Sigil of Venom** (Snake) — surrounded by poison traps
   - **Sigil of Dominion** (Kings) — Void Cult priests attack on sight

9. **Ironhold East & West** — Upgrade weapons with void crystal alloys.
   The Engineer has found pre-Breach ruins with Sigil markings in the mines.
   The Master Smith will forge V-weapons with crystal and ore.

### Act 3: The Shards (Levels 7-12)

**Objective:** Descend the four key Abysses to recover the Shards.

10. **Thornhaven** — The Mycologist discovered spore patterns matching the
    Sigil glyphs. The forest itself remembers the old seals.

11. **The Last Wall** — Final preparations. Commander's orders:
    *"Find the Shards. Seal the Breach. That is our only hope."*
    The Spy reveals the Cult channels rift energy to the Voidborn.

12. **Abyss of Flame (MAPM)** — 8 levels of magma and fire. Retrieve the
    **Shard of the Sun** from the deepest chamber. Vision of the Breach.

13. **Abyss of Madness (MAPN)** — 8 levels of shifting reality. Retrieve
    the **Shard of the Moon**. Do not follow the singing.

14. **Abyss of Serpents (MAPO)** — 8 levels of poison and ambush. Retrieve
    the **Shard of the Heart** from the mother serpent's nest.

15. **Abyss of Time (MAPQ)** — 8 levels of temporal distortion. Retrieve
    the **Shard of the Skull**. Wrap it — do not touch bare-handed.

16. **Deep Reef (MAPL)** — Optional but valuable. The Coral Sage provides
    ancient lore. Beware the dividing creatures.

### Act 4: Confrontation (Levels 12+)

**Objective:** Seal the Breach.

17. **The Chronarch's Sanctum (TIME)** — With all four Sigils and four
    Shards, navigate the null field maze to the central ankh.

18. **The Voidborn's Nexus (MAPZ)** — The final area. Crystallized void
    matter, populated by Abyssals, Watchers, and the Voidborn's avatar.

19. **Insert the tokens** — Use (O)ther command + "Search" at the central
    ankh. The eight tokens combine to form the seal.

    The order for the Cards: **Love, Sol, Moon, Death**
    (Shard of the Heart, Shard of the Sun, Shard of the Moon, Shard of the
    Skull)

20. **The Seal activates.** The Breach closes. The Voidborn's connection to
    reality is severed. The Ashen Realm begins to heal. The Prophet's Bastion
    reopens.

    But the scars remain.

## 14. NPC DIALOG GUIDE

  certainty."*
- **The Eyeless Seer**: *"I tore out my eyes so I could truly see. The void

## 15. COMBAT STRATEGY

### Monster Abilities and Counters

| Ability | Effect | Counter |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Poison | Ongoing damage per turn | Purge spell, Mender shop |
| Sleep | Incapacitates character | Bless spell, attack to wake |
| Negate | Nullifies all magic | Physical weapons only |
| Teleport | Erratic movement | Focus fire when possible |
| Divide | Splits into two on damage | Area damage spells |
| Boss | Higher stats, special attacks | Sustained damage, healing |

### Formation Tips

- Keep Tharn (Fighter) in front to absorb damage
- Position Lyra (Wizard) behind the line — she has the lowest HP
- Kael (Ranger) is versatile — ranged or melee as needed
- Mira (Thief) works best from flanking positions
- *"Corners are death traps. Keep your healer behind the line and flanks
  clear."* — Pit Master, Castle Arena

### Early Game (Ash Plains, Levels 1-5)

- Thralls fear fire but resist cold. Strike fast before they swarm.
- Use Spark and Shard spells freely — MP is abundant at this stage.
- Mend and Glow are your most-used Warding Rites.
- Prioritize upgrading Tharn's weapon and Lyra's armor.

### Mid Game (Forests, Spires, Levels 5-10)

- Transition to V-weapons (void-touched) as soon as possible.
- Poison becomes common — keep Purge available at all times.
- Start managing food economy carefully (double depletion rate).
- Ichor Wells can boost stats but are risky.

### Deep Abyss (Levels 7-8)

- **Magic is unreliable.** Negate-capable creatures are everywhere.
- Equip the best physical weapons you can find.
- Warding Rites (healing) still work on your party — but offensive spells
  will be negated by enemies.
- Bring maximum torches, keys, and gems.
- *"Beyond this wall, reality thins. Trust your blade, not your eyes."*

### Boss Fights

- Bosses have the highest stats and often negate magic.
- Focus all damage on one boss at a time.
- Keep Heal and Restore ready — bosses hit extremely hard.
- The Voidborn itself (HP 255, ATK 150, DEF 99) cannot be killed by
  conventional means. The seal is the only solution.
