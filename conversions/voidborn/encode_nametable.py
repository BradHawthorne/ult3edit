"""Generate hex-encoded name-table data for the Voidborn total conversion.

The ULT3 name-table is 921 bytes of null-terminated high-ASCII strings at
offset $397A. This script encodes all replacement names and outputs the hex
string suitable for: ult3edit patch edit ULT3 --region name-table --data <HEX>

The last ~25 bytes of the vanilla name-table contain "BLOAD DDRW" and a
code fragment used by the disk loader. This script preserves them by reading
the original file if provided, or padding with nulls otherwise.

Usage:
    python encode_nametable.py                    # Output hex (nulls for tail)
    python encode_nametable.py /path/to/ULT3      # Preserve BLOAD DDRW tail
    python encode_nametable.py --apply /path/to/ULT3  # Apply directly
